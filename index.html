            <h4>A TR Grimm adventure</h4>
            <p>This adventure article uses the full array of offered materials from Wizards of the Coast pulling most heavily from: 
                    Volo's Guide to Monsters (from here forward referred to as VGM); Xanathar’s Guide to Everything (to be 
                    referred to as XGE). Unlike many modules and adventure guides this article can also be used as an overarching 
                    adventure setting with the stalwart City in the Mountain and its varied and  admittedly… eccentric inhabitants 
                    acting as a colorful, rich and dangerous background to parties of any size and power level. With that being 
                    said this is to act as an introduction to the City State of Kathran’dure, the Mercentocrocy, The Mountain 
                    Guard and the Rouge’s Court as well as other important and notable individuals that claim the Kathran Ranges 
                    and Kathran’dure itself home. The links on the left will take you to the purchase links for both the VGM and the 
                    XGE as well as a linkn to the Wizards of the Coast store for any other products you might need to grab. </p>
